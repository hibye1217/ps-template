# PS Template

Written with Typora. So if some MathJax are broken on GitHub, download and read with your local device.

This repository is more of a cheat-sheet than learning. Do not try to learn new algorithm at here.

I mean, you can check what you know and don't know, but you probably cannot **learn** it here.
